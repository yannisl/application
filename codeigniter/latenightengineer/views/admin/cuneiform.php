        The <em class="highlight">three_column</em> panel can fetch and display as many pragraphs of Lorem text for prototyping. There is a similar
        one available, that also sets some images and headings.

      I have just stumbled across the {{wi:Cuneiform_Digital_Library_Initiative}} (CDLI), which contains images and catalog information for cuneiform tablets dating from ca. 3350 B.C., or the age when writing began. As of February 8, 2008, the collection contained 225,000 cuneiform texts and 85,000 images. The CDLI brings together the collections of sixteen digital library collections.

The collection is gorgeously photographed and allows you to zoom in to a degree on each of the tablets. Not only is it a joy to peruse, but it is exhillarating to see so many ancient texts from over 5,000 years ago.

The image shown is from The Hearst Museum of Anthropology at UC Berkeley and is from the Early Dynastic period, or ca. 2600-2350 B.C.

        Long term thoughts. How would the digital information survive? For the next 1000 years? Will it just be arrangements of quanta?
