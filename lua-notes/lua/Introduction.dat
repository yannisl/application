<h2>Introduction</h2>

My first brush with Lua was with LuaTeX and LuaLaTeX an extension of the TeX and friends typesetting system developed by Knuth and the TeX community.

Currently, many languages are concerned with how to help you write programs
with hundreds of thousands of lines. For that, they offer you {{wi:package}}s, name
spaces, complex type systems, myriads of constructions, and thousands of documentation
pages to be studied.

Lua does not try to help you write programs with hundreds of thousands of
lines. Instead, Lua tries to help you solve your problem with only hundreds of
lines, or even less. To achieve this aim, Lua relies on extensibility, like many
other languages. But, unlike most other languages, Lua is easily extended not
only with software written in Lua itself, but also with software written in other
languages, such as C/C++.

Lua was designed, from the beginning, to be easily integrated with software
written in C and other conventional languages. This duality of languages
brings many benefits. Lua is a very small and simple language, partially because
it does not try to do what C is already good for, such as sheer performance, low
level operations, or interface with third-party software. Lua relies on C for those
tasks. What Lua offers you is what C is not good for: a good distance from the
hardware, dynamic structures, no redundancies, ease of testing and debugging.
For that, Lua has a secure environment, automatic memory management, and
great facility to handle strings and other kinds of data with dynamic size.
More than being an extensible language, Lua is mainly a glue language.

Lua supports a component-based approach to software development, where we
create an application by gluing together high-level components. Usually, these
components are written in a a compiled, statically typed language, such as
C or C++; Lua is the glue we use to compose and connect those components.
Usually, the components (or objects) represent more concrete, low level concepts
(such as widgets and data structures), which are not subject to many changes
during program development, and which take the bulk of the CPU time of the
final program. Lua gives the final shape of the application, which will probably
change a lot during the life-cycle of the product. But, unlike some other glue
technologies, Lua is a full-fledged language as well. Therefore, we can use Lua
not only to glue components, but also to adapt and reshape them, or even to
create whole new components


Of course, Lua is not the only scripting language around. There are other

languages that you can use for more or less the same purposes, such as Perl,
Tcl, Ruby, Forth, or Python. The following features set Lua apart from these
languages; although some other languages share some of these features with
Lua, no other language offers a similar profile:
Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢ Extensibility: the extensibility of Lua is so remarkable that many people
regard Lua not as a language, but as a kit for building domain specific languages.
Lua has been designed from scratch to be extended both through
Lua code and through external C code. As a proof of concept, it implements
most of its own basic functionality through external libraries. It is
really easy to interface Lua with C (or other language).
Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢ Simplicity: Lua is a simple and small language. It has few (but powerful)
concepts. That makes Lua easy to learn, and also makes for a small
implementation.
Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢ Efficiency: Lua has a quite efficient implementation. Several benchmarks
show Lua as one of the fastest languages in the realm of scripting (interpreted)
languages.
Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¯Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¿Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â¢ Portability: when we talk about portability, we are not talking about a
program that runs both in Windows and Unix platforms. We are talking
about a program that runs in all platforms we ever heard about: NextStep,
OS/2, PlayStation II (Sony), Mac ??, BeOS, MS-DOS, OS-9, OSX, EPOC,
PalmOS, plus of course all flavors of Unix (Linux, Solaris, SunOS, AIX,
ULTRIX, IRIX) and Windows (3.1, NT, 95, 98, 2000, Millenium Edition).
The source code for each of these platforms is virtually the same. Lua does
not use #ifs to adapt its code to different machines; instead, it sticks to
the standard ANSI (ISO) C. That way, usually you do not need to adapt
it to a new environment: If you have an ANSI C compiler, you just have
to compile Lua.

Typically, Lua users fall into three broad groups: those that use Lua already
{{em:embedded}} in an application program, those that use Lua stand alone, and
those that use Lua and C together.

Many people use Lua embedded in an application program, such as <a href="http://keplerproject.github.com/cgilua/">CGILua</a>

(for building dynamic Web pages), LuaMan (for network management), or LuaOrb
(for accessing CORBA objects). These applications use Lua's API to
register new functions, and tag methods (also called fallbacks) to create new
types and to change the behavior of some language operations, configuring Lua
for their specific domain. Frequently, the users of such applications do not even
know that Lua is an independent language adapted for that domain; for instance,
CGILua users tend to think of Lua as a language specifically designed
for the Web.


Lua is also useful as a stand-alone language, mainly for text-processing and quick-
{{wi: quick-and-dirty}} little programs. For such uses, the main functionality of Lua
comes from its standard libraries, which offer pattern-matching and other functions
for string handling. In fact, we can regard the stand-alone language as the
embedding of Lua in the domain of string and (text) file manipulation.
Finally, there are those programmers that work on the other side of the
bench, writing applications that use Lua as a library. Those people will program
more in C than in Lua, although they need a good understanding of Lua to create
interfaces which are simple, ease to use, and well integrated with the language.

Although this book focuses on the stand-alone use of the language, most
techniques described here can be applied when Lua is being used embedded
into another application.

##LuaRocks

<a href="http://luarocks.org/LuaRocks">LuaRocks</a>allows you to install Lua modules as self-contained packages called {{em:rocks}} which also contain version dependency information. 

This information is used both during installation, so that when one rock is requested all rocks it depends on are installed as well, and at run time, so that when a module is required, the correct version is loaded. LuaRocks supports both local and remote repositories, and multiple local rocks trees. LuaRocks is available both for Unix and Windows.

###Useful Tools

One of the amazing things about Lua is it can be used almost anywhere. There is a CNC toolkit available at <a href="http://www.exgenia.com/">exgenia</a>, it can even import dxf files, which are the defacto CAD standard. This can be quite useful, if you like myself have an engineering background.
