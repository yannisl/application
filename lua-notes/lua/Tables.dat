<h2>Tables</h2>
Lua uses tables (which are a kind of associative array) a generic data type.

Tables are the
main (in fact, the only) data structuring mechanism in Lua, and a powerful
one. Tables can be used not only to represent ordinary arrays, but also symbol
tables, sets, records, queues, and other data structures, in simple and efficient
ways.

Tables in Lua are neither values nor variables, but {{em:objects}}. If you are familiar
with arrays in Java or Scheme, then you have a fair idea of what we mean by
objects. However, if your idea of an array comes from C or Pascal, you have
to open your mind a bit. You may think of a table as a dynamically allocated
object; your program only manipulates references (or pointers) to them. 

 There
are no hidden copies or creation of new tables behind the scenes. Moreover, you
do not have to declare table; in fact, there is no way to declare anything in Lua. Tables are only created by means of constructor expressions, which in its
simplest form is written as <tt>{}</tt>:

<div class="code-block console-wrap"><div class="code-block code"><code class="PHP">
-- program to demonstrate
-- tables in Lua
NameToInstr = {["John"] = "rhythm guitar",
                      ["Paul"]  = "bass guitar",
                      ["George"] = "lead guitar",
                      ["Ringo"] = "drumkit" }
 print(NameToInstr["Paul"])

-- creates a new table, and stores a reference to it in 'a'
a = {}
k = "x"
a[k] = 10 -- new field, with key="x" and value=10
a[20] = "great" -- new field, with key=20 and value="great"
print(a["x"]) --> 10
k = 20
print(a[k]) --> "great"
a["x"] = a["x"]+1 -- increments field "x"
print(a["x"]) --> 11
</code>
</div>
<div  id ="msg1" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>

When a program has no references left to a table, Lua memory management
will eventually deletes it, and reuse its memory.
Each table may store values with different types of indices, and it grows as
it needs to accommodate new fields:


<div class="code-block console-wrap"><div class="code-block code"><code class="PHP">
-- program to demonstrate
-- tables in Lua
NameToInstr = {["John"] = "rhythm guitar",
                      ["Paul"]  = "bass guitar",
                      ["George"] = "lead guitar",
                      ["Ringo"] = "drumkit" }
for k,v in pairs (NameToInstr) do 
    print(k..' '..v..'&lt;br /&gt;') 
end
