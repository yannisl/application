<h3>Expressions</h3>
Expressions denote values. Expressions in Lua include the numeric constants
and string literals, variables, unary and binary operations, and function calls;
expressions can be also the quite unconventional upvalues, function definitions,
and constructors.

###Arithmetic Operators

Lua supports the usual arithmetic operators: the binary + (addition), - (subtraction),
* (multiplication), / (division) and the {{wi:unary}} - (negation). All of
them operate over real numbers.

Lua also offers partial support for ^ (exponentiation). One of the design
goals of Lua is to have a tiny core. An exponentiation operation (through the
pow function in C) would mean that Lua should be linked with the C mathematic
library. To avoid this, the core of Lua offers only the syntax for the ^
binary operator, which have the higher precedence among all operations. The
mathematic library (which is standard, but not part of the Lua core) then gives
to this operator its expected meaning.


<div class="code-block console-wrap">
<div class="code-block code">
<code class="php">
a=3
b=a^0.02
print(b)
</code>
</div>
<div  id ="msg1" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>

However, it is customary in Lua to start arrays with index 1. Many functions
in the Lua libraries (e.g. sort and tinsert) adhere to this convention, and so,
if your arrays also start with 1, you will be able to use those functions directly.
We can use constructors to create and initialize arrays in a single expression:

Such constructors can be as large as you need (well, up to a few million elements).

<div class="code-block code">

<code class="PHP">
--  squares
squares = {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81}
print(squares[4])
</code>

<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>

##Matrices and Multi-dimensional Arrays
There are two main ways to represent matrices in Lua. The first one is to
use an array of arrays, that is, a table wherein each element is another table.
For instance, you can create a matrix of zeros with dimensions N, M with the
following code:
<div class="code-block console-wrap">
<div class="code-block code">
<code class="PHP">
mt = {} -- create the matrix
for i=1,N do
    mt[i] = {} -- create a new row
for j=1,M do
   while j <= M do
     mt[i][j] = 0
end
end

mt = {} -- create the matrix
for i=1,N do
for j=1,M do
mt[i*M+j] = 0
end
end
</code>
</div>
<div  id ="msg1" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>

Remember that tables are objects in Lua. You have to explicitly create each row to create
a matrix. At one hand, this is certainly more verbose than simply declaring a
matrix, as you do in C or Pascal. On the other hand, that gives you more
flexibility. For instance, you can create a diagonal matrix changing the line

<div class="code-block console-wrap">
<div class="code-block code">
<code class="PHP">
mt = {} -- create the matrix
for i=1,5 do
for j=1,5 do
mt[i*M+j] = 0
end
end
</code>
</div>
<div  id ="msg1" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>
