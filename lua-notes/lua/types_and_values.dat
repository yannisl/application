<h2>Types and Values</h2>

Lua is a dynamically typed language. There are no type definitions in the language; each values carries its own type.

There are six basic types in Lua: {{em: nil}}, number, string, userdata, function and <em>table</em>.

Lua does not have a boolean type, nut uses nil to represent false in boolean expressions (any other value is considered true). A global variable has a nil value until you assign it a value.

Number represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers. There
is no distinction between integers and floating-point numbers in Lua. Numeric
constants may be written with an optional decimal part, and an optional decimal
exponent. Examples of valid numeric constants are:


{{snippet:
  4 4. .4 0.4 4.57e-3 0.3e12 }}

###Tables
The type table implements associative arrays. An associative array is an
array that can be indexed not only with numbers, but also with strings or any
other value of the language (except nil). Also, tables have no fixed size; you
can dynamically add as many elements as you want to a table. Tables are the
main (in fact, the only) data structuring mechanism in Lua, and a powerful
one. Tables can be used not only to represent ordinary arrays, but also symbol
tables, sets, records, queues, and other data structures, in simple and efficient
ways.

Tables in Lua are neither values nor variables, but objects. If you are familiar
with arrays in Java or Scheme, then you have a fair idea of what we mean by
objects. However, if your idea of an array comes from C or Pascal, you have
to open your mind a bit. You may think of a table as a dynamically allocated
object; your program only manipulates references (or pointers) to them. There
are no hidden copies or creation of new tables behind the scenes. Moreover, you
do not have to {{em:declare}} a table; in fact, there is no way to declare anything in
Lua. Tables are only created by means of constructor expressions, which in its
simplest form is written as {}:


<div class="code-block console-wrap"><div class="code-block code"><code class="PHP">
-- creates a new table, and stores a reference to it in {{em:a}}
a = {}
k = "x"
a[k] = 10               -- new field, with key="x" and value=10
a[20] = "great"        -- new field, with key=20 and value="great"
print(a["x"])            --> 10
k = 20
print(a[k])              --> "great"
a["x"] = a["x"]+1      -- increments field "x"
print(a["x"])            --> 11
</code>
</div>
<div  id ="msg1" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>

A table is always {{em:anonymous}}. There is no fixed relationship between a variable
that holds a table and the table itself.


<div class="code-block console-wrap"><div class="code-block code"><code class="PHP">
-- tables are anonymous
a = {}
a["x"] = 10
b = a                -- ‘b’ refers to the same table as ‘a’
print(b["x"])       --> 10
b["x"] = 20
print(a["x"])       --> 20
a = nil               -- now only ‘b’ still refers to the table
b = nil               -- now there is no references left to the table
print(a)
</code>
</div>
<div  id ="msg1" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>

Some programmers use a notation for arguments that start with an underscore. It is a convention and not a requirement.

<div class="code-block console-wrap"><div class="code-block code"><code class="PHP">
-- program to demonstrate
-- functions in Lua
a = 'vorher'
function summe( _v1, _v2)
	local a = _v1 + _v2
	return  a
end

print( summe( 1, 2 ) )
print( a )
print( _v1 )

</code>
</div>
<div  id ="msg1" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>

Functions are values:

<div class="code-block console-wrap"><div class="code-block code"><code class="PHP">
-- program to demonstrate
-- functions in Lua
a = 'vorher'
z = function summe( _v1, _v2)
	local a = _v1 + _v2
	return  a
end

print(z)

</code>
</div>
<div  id ="msg1" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>


###Anonymous Functions
Anonymous functions in Lua are very similar to those in JavaScript. You can have a self-executing function as follows:

<div class="code-block console-wrap"><div class="code-block code"><code class="PHP">
-- program to demonstrate
-- functions in Lua
(function (a,b)
print(a+b) end)(3,3)
</code>
</div>
<div  id ="msg1" class="msg">
</div>
<div class="console"></div>
<button class="evalPerl">Run Code!</button>
<ol class="results"></ol> 
</div>
